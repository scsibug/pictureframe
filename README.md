# pictureframe

Display high-resolution photos to a e-ink picture frame, controlled by
a server application.

The client is a Raspberry Pi driving a [Waveshare 7.8" HD e-ink
display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.8inch_e-Paper_HAT), and the
server is running Python to determine what pictures are displayed, and
how to retrieve them.

Code for converting images into grayscale indexed color is included as
well.
